# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Project Highlights:

-The game dynamically alternates between Player X and Player O, providing real-time turn updates.
-It detects wins across rows, columns, and diagonals, highlighting the winning tiles in green and announcing the winner.
-In the event of a tie, it marks the game as a draw and visually represents the outcome in red.
-The game manages its state effectively: it tracks moves, ends the game once a win or tie is detected, and prevents further interaction after the result.

ðŸ’¡ Technical Details:

-Used GridLayout for the game board and BorderLayout for the UI structure, keeping the design simple and intuitive.
-Implemented ActionListeners to handle user inputs and update the game state in real-time.
-The project was an excellent exercise in building responsive UIs and handling event-driven programming in Java.
